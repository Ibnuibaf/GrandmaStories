            <h5 class="card-title">!Doctor,Doctor</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The first day, the children asked, ‘Ajji, how do you know so many stories?’
                Ajji smiled and answered, ‘My grandmother told me many stories. Some I
                read in books. A few I learnt from youngsters like you, and the rest from your
                Ajja.’ Then Ajji paused and said, ‘I see all of you have grown a lot since the last
                time I saw you. So before I start telling any stories, I want to know what each of
                you want to be when you grow up.’
                Raghu, who was eleven years old, and the oldest of all, said immediately, ‘I
                want to be an environment scientist.’ Meenu, who was nine, said, ‘I have not
                decided, maybe a computer person like my dad.’ Anand, who was ten, said, ‘I
                want to be an astronaut,’ and his twin sister Krishna firmly said, ‘I want to
                become a fashion designer.’ Ajji smiled. ‘I am glad all of you have thought about
                this. We should always have some aim in life which we must try to achieve
                while being of help to others. Now let me tell you a story of a person who learnt
                just such a lesson.’
                Shall we, too, join Ajji and her gang of young friends and hear the story?
                On a blazing hot summer afternoon, an old man came walking down a narrow
                village path. He was tired and thirsty. Right by the road, he spotted a tiny
                grocery store. It had a tin roof and mud walls. The shopkeeper sat inside fanning
                himself and shooing away the flies that were buzzing around in the stifling heat.
                There was a little bench in front of the store where the villagers met when
                evening came and the land had cooled down. The old man flopped down on the
                bench. He was so tired that for a while he could not speak. Finally, he opened his
                mouth and uttered one word, ‘Water!’

                Now, this village had been facing a horrible problem for a long time. It was
                near a great desert and the rains came only once a year to fill its ponds and wells.
                But the rains had disappeared for the last two years, and the villagers had been
                making do with water from a faraway stream. Every morning groups of men and
                women walked a long distance, filled their pots from the little stream and used
                that the whole day. Naturally, no one wanted to waste even a drop of this
                precious water.
                Yet how do you say no to a thirsty, tired old man when he asks for water?
                Without a second thought, the shopkeeper, Ravi, who was very kindhearted,
                poured out a tumbler of water from his pot and gave it to the old man. The man
                drank it up greedily. Then he said one more word: ‘More!’ And without waiting
                for Ravi to give it to him, he lunged for the pot, picked it up and lifting it to his
                lips drank up Ravi’s entire day’s supply of water!
                Poor Ravi, what could he do? He just stared in dismay. Then he told himself,
                ‘Never mind. After all, I did help someone in need.’
                The stranger, meanwhile, now seemed to feel better. He handed the pot back
                to Ravi, gave a smile that filled Ravi’s heart with warmth and said, ‘My son,
                always be kind like this. Help everyone who comes to you like you helped me,
                and you will be blessed.’ Then he picked up his stick and slowly hobbled down
                the road. Ravi watched the strange old man disappear into the distance, then
                returned to his shop.
                The afternoon heat grew worse. After a while Ravi felt his head was about to
                burst with a headache. His lips were parched and his throat hurt, it was so dry.
                He really needed a drink of water. But the visitor had finished it all up! Hoping
                to coax a drop or two out of the pot, Ravi lifted it to his lips and tilted it. Imagine
                his surprise when a gush of water ran down his face! It was sweet, refreshing
                water which not only quenched his thirst, but wiped out his headache too.
                Ravi was staring at the water pot, trying to figure out what had just happened,
                when Karim limped into his shop. Karim was a young man who had hurt his leg
                in an accident many years ago which had left him with a limp. When he was
                unwell or tired, his limp became worse. Karim, too, flopped down on the bench
                in front of the store and caught his breath, like the old man. Then he fished out a
                shopping list from his pocket and handed it to Ravi. As Ravi started packing up
                the items listed on the paper, Karim opened a little bundle of food and ate his
                lunch sitting on the bench. Finally he wiped his mouth on his scarf and pointed
                to Ravi’s pot of water. ‘Mind if I take a little sip? It is so hot after all.’
                Ravi was busy measuring out some dal. He said without looking up, ‘I would
                be happy to offer you some, but someone’s already had most of it. Then I was
                feeling unwell and I think I finished the last of it.’
                ‘What are you saying, my friend? I can clearly see the pot brimming over with
                water!’
                Ravi looked up and stared in disbelief. In front of his eyes, Karim poured out
                a tumblerful of water and drank it. Then he paid for all his groceries and left the
                store.
                Did his limp look as if it was nearly gone? Ravi watched him for a while
                trying to figure out, then decided the heat was playing tricks on his mind and
                went back into the cool comfort of his shop and dozed off.
                He woke with a start as someone was calling his name urgently. He opened his
                eyes to find Karim back. This time he was holding by the hand his little sister
                Fatima. ‘Brother, wake up. We need your help,’ Karim urged.
                ‘Wh-what? Is something wrong?’
                ‘Fatima is burning up with fever!’
                ‘Then go to a doctor, why have you got her to a grocery shop?’
                Karim stared at him and said, ‘You mean you don’t know how you just helped
                me? My leg, which has been troubling me for the last many years, healed up on
                its own as soon as I drank the water from your magic pitcher! Give Fatima a
                drink from it, too. I am sure her fever will disappear in no time.’
                Ravi was astounded. Magic pitcher? Healing water? What was Karim going
                on about? Nonetheless he passed the pot to Fatima. She drank a bit, then sat
                down to rest. Within minutes she lifted her head and said, ‘It is true, brothers! I
                am indeed cured of the fever!’
                Soon the news spread in the village like wildfire. Ravi, the quiet, kind grocery
                storekeeper, was now the owner of a magic pitcher, the waters from which could
                heal anyone of any disease. Every night Ravi left the pitcher in the store, and in
                the morning it would be filled to the brim with sweet, cool water. Daily, a queue
                of sick people and their relatives collected in front of his shop. To each one Ravi
                gave a drink of the water, and they went away saying they were now better. The
                pot was never empty. Ravi realized the old man he had helped must have given
                him this gift in gratitude. Ravi understood what a great gift it was and thanked
                him daily in his mind.
                Soon his little store turned into a hospital. Ravi did not charge a paisa for the
                water. People would leave some money, some gifts for him, and others did not
                pay him anything but he was still happy with that.
                One day, a rich landlord’s servant appeared at his doorstep and said, ‘My
                master is unwell. Come with me and give him a drink of your water.’
                Ravi replied, ‘See the crowd of people behind you, waiting for their turn. How
                can I leave without helping them and go to your master? Do you think these sick
                people can stand in the sun for long? Tell your master to come to me instead and
                I will give him the water here.’
                The servant said, ‘Ravi, what will you get by helping these poor people? A
                few rupees? Some rice and dal? Come to my master’s house. He will shower you
                with money and gifts. Your worries about making ends meet will be over for at
                least a month.’
                Ravi was tempted. It was true, why not cure one rich man and get some help
                in buying his daily needs? Ravi told the people waiting outside to come back the
                next day and went with the servant to the landlord.
                Slowly, in this way, Ravi changed. Where once he could not bear to see the
                pain and sadness of the sick and poor people, he now started each day hoping he
                would get one rich patient at least, who would pay him handsomely.
                Days passed thus. Seasons changed and it was summer once more. Ravi was
                in his old store, writing up his accounts, when the voice of an old man quavered
                in his ear, ‘Son, water!’
                Startled, he looked up. Was it the same old man who had given him the gift of
                the magic pitcher? But right behind the visitor was none other than the king’s
                messenger. ‘Come quickly!’ the messenger shouted. ‘The queen has been bitten
                by a mosquito!’
                ‘Water!’ the old man repeated.
                ‘The queen is unwell!’ the messenger shouted again.
                Ravi looked from one to the other. One was a grubby old man who may or
                may not be the same person who gave him the pitcher. On the other side a
                messenger from the king himself! He pictured the gold coins showering down on
                him once his healing water soothed the queen’s mosquito bites. The choice was
                clear.
                He picked up his pitcher and said to the stranger, ‘Wait right here, Uncle, I’ll
                be back soon.’
                The king’s swift-footed horses took him to the palace. There he rushed to the
                queen who was staring in dismay at the mosquito bites on her arm. He tilted the
                pitcher to pour some water into a tumbler, but nothing came! Again and again he
                tilted the pitcher. He turned it upside down and stared into its depths. It was dry
                as a bone.
                ‘You cheat!’ the king roared. ‘So this is how you have been fooling the people
                of my kingdom! Get out, and never let me hear that you have acquired magical
                healing powers. If you claim such a thing again I will banish you forever from
                the village.’ Then he turned to comfort his queen who was splashing tears on the
                bump on her arm.
                Ravi slowly walked back to his village. He went to his shop. No one was
                there. He searched for the old man who had asked for water. He was nowhere to
                be seen. He called out, ‘Uncle, I am sorry. I made a mistake. Please do come. I
                will give you water.’ But there was no reply. Now he realized this was the same
                old man whom he met a year back.
                He remembered the people he had healed once out of kindness and
                compassion and how much they had blessed and loved him in return. He
                remembered their little acts of generosity, sparing him a few coins, a bundle of
                vegetables from their garden in return for the water. When did he become so
                selfish and greedy that he would neglect the people who had needed him the
                most? The old man had taken back his powers when he sensed Ravi had misused
                the gift.
                Never mind, Ravi smiled to himself. He would use the money he had received
                for the water to help bring a real doctor to the village, someone who would help
                the people with his knowledge of medicines and diseases, so that they need not
                wait for a magician to cure them of their illnesses.
                From that day onwards Ravi filled his pitcher with ordinary water from the
                stream and carried it back carefully to his little store and waited for the old man.
                Maybe one day he would be back, but till then, Ravi was determined to bring a
                real medicine man to his village.
                Ajji finished her story and looked around at the four little faces around her.
                Raghu was deep in thought. Ajji smiled at him. Then the children shouted, ‘Ajji,
                tell one more story!’
                ‘Ah ha,’ Ajji said, ‘too many stories a day are not good either. One laddoo is
                very sweet, very delicious but if you eat laddoos all the time it’s no fun. Go and
                play outside. Tomorrow I will tell you another story.’ With that she got up and
                went to the kitchen to supervise the dinner.

            <h5 class="card-title">Kavery and the Theif</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The children had gone with their Ajja to the paddy fields that morning. They
                were all city kids and did not know a thing about farming! On the way, Anand
                was surprised to see a bird’s nest on top of the tree. He said to Ajja, ‘I wonder
                how birds decide where and how to make their nests!’ Ajja said, ‘The straw in
                the nest is from the paddy field. Do you know, farming helps human beings as
                well as birds?’ Krishna replied, ‘Ajja, I thought wheat and rice can be just
                plucked from trees, like mangoes. But today I realized there is so much work in
                farming.’
                That afternoon, after lunch, when they gathered around Ajji for the day’s
                story, she looked sharply at the children. They had enjoyed learning about
                farming activities like cleaning seeds and separating the straw from paddy. In the
                city everything came from the supermarket, but here they had seen how things
                were really produced.
                Ajji said, ‘Farming is very important. If farmers do not grow any food, what
                will we all eat?’
                Anand said thoughtfully, ‘If farmers do such important work, why are they so
                poor?’
                ‘That’s true, my dear,’ Ajji sighed, fanning herself. ‘Of course there are rich
                farmers too, people who own lots of land. But many in our country till small
                pieces of land, and so make less money.’
                Then seeing the kids’ crestfallen faces, she put down her fan, sat up and said,
                ‘But I can tell you of a poor farmer woman who did not remain very poor. All
                due to her sharp wit!’
                ‘Tell Ajji! Do tell!’ the kids yelled. So Ajji started her story.
                Kavery’s lazy husband annoyed her no end. There she was working like a
                donkey in the fields, ploughing and watering and tending a hard, dry piece of
                land, while her husband snored away happily at home! Why, once when a
                stranger came asking for some food and water, he just pointed towards the
                kitchen and went back to sleep. The stranger, thankfully, was an honest man and
                took only enough for himself and his horse. Not that there was much to steal in
                Kavery’s little house. They were poor farmers with only a patch of land where
                nothing seemed to grow. Somehow Kavery tilled the land, did some odd jobs in
                the neighbourhood, and made ends meet.
                The land was right next to a temple. On some days her husband would come
                along with her on the pretext of helping her, but no sooner would her back be
                turned than she would find him stretched out near the temple courtyard gossiping
                with passing villagers.
                One day, as she was working in the field, trying to dig up the ground so she
                could sow some seeds, a thin man with a big moustache appeared beside her. He
                was a thief, and up to no good. Kavery, of course, did not know this. She greeted
                him politely and went back to her work. Now the thief wanted to steal the coins
                that were given as offerings in the temple and perhaps even the ornaments on the
                idol. The only way into the temple was by digging his way in from Kavery’s
                land. But how could he do anything there, with this tough, no-nonsense woman
                working away?
                Guessing Kavery was hard up for money, he whispered to her, ‘Sister, why are
                you working so hard on this barren land? I will give you one thousand rupees,
                sell it to me.’
                Kavery raised her eyebrows; why did he want to buy the land for so much
                money? Surely something was wrong . . .
                The thief sensed she was not about to sell it to him, so he raised his price: ‘A
                thousand and fifty? No? Two thousand? No again? FIVE THOUSAND? No?’
                Kavery kept shaking her head. She did not like this odd-looking man who was
                offering her so much money for the field. Clearly he had some evil plans.
                Finally, to keep him quiet, she made up a story. ‘I will never sell this land. You
                see, it belonged to my ancestors. Now we are poor, but I am told that once our
                family was very rich. Though we lost a lot of our money, much of it was also
                buried here, in this field by one ancestor, to keep it safe from robbers. Then
                people forgot about it for years and years. My husband found a clue to the
                location of the hidden treasure just a few days back. Why do you think I am
                digging this hard earth? Not to sow seeds, oh no, that’s just what everyone
                thinks. I am actually looking for hidden treasure!’
                The thief was stunned. He felt this woman was really innocent, giving such
                important information to a stranger. He thought, why should I not take advantage
                of this situation? Here he was, hoping to steal a few coins from the temple, and
                this woman was telling him about hidden treasure! He replied in a very humble
                way, ‘Yes sister, I understand; after all it is your family treasure. Only you
                should get it.’ He pretended to walk away, and went and hid himself a little way
                down the road.
                Night fell; Kavery packed up her tools and headed home. The temple, too,
                emptied out and the priest locked it up for the night. Then at midnight, when all
                was quiet and the night creatures were coming out of their homes, the thief crept
                into the field.
                All night he dug and dug, looking for treasure, but of course there was no sign
                of it as there never had been any treasure to begin with! By the time dawn broke
                he realized Kavery had made a fool of him and all he could do now was get
                away from the field fast.
                When Kavery reached the field she grinned to herself. Just as she had
                expected, the thief had spent the night digging up the land nicely for her. All she
                needed to do now was sow the seeds. She worked hard in the field for the next
                few months and managed to grow a good crop. She sold those and finally they
                had some money. With a part of this money Kavery bought some jewellery.

                Many months later, the thief decided to show his face in the village again. He
                was careful to disguise himself, though. He trimmed his long moustaches, tied a
                colourful turban and pretended to be a travelling salesman. No sooner had he
                stepped into the village than he saw Kavery going about her work. But what is
                this . . . Instead of the simple, unadorned lady he saw last year, she was now
                wearing jewellery which looked as though it had been in the family for years!
                Surely she must have located that missing treasure finally! He was determined to
                look in her house and find the rest of her money and treasure.
                That night, he appeared at Kavery’s house and said to her husband, ‘I am a
                traveller and don’t have a place to spend the night. Please give me shelter for the
                night.’
                Kavery’s husband agreed immediately. Kavery, however, glimpsed the man
                from inside the house and saw through his disguise. She knew he must be
                planning some robbery, so she said in a loud voice, making sure the visitor heard
                her, ‘Oh dear, your dear aunt is all alone at night and has asked us to come stay
                with her. You know how the dark scares her when your uncle is not there. Come,
                let us go there for the night.’ Then lowering her voice a bit, yet making sure she
                was heard clearly, she continued, ‘Don’t worry about the jewels. I have hidden
                them in little holes in the house walls. No one will suspect the hiding spot.’ Then
                she came out and in her normal voice told the thief, ‘Brother, you can sleep in
                the veranda. The house will be locked. Here is some food and water for you. We
                will come tomorrow morning.’ The thief smiled to himself at Kavery’s
                foolishness.
                Her husband, meanwhile, stared at her with an open mouth, wondering which
                aunt and what jewels she was talking about. When she firmly walked off, he
                followed obediently.
                The thief could not believe his luck. He had the entire night to comb through
                the house, tap all the walls and look for the hidden stash of gold ornaments. So
                he started. Tap tap tap. Kick, punch and shove. He prowled and he tapped, he
                kicked and he pushed the walls, hoping to spot the jewels. Finally he tore down
                all the walls. But, of course, there was nothing he could find. Exhausted he fell
                asleep and woke only with the crowing of the cock as the sun rose. Quickly he
                found his little bundle of things and ran off. Within minutes Kavery and her
                husband returned.
                ‘Oh Kavery, see what the bad man has done to our house! You gave him food
                and shelter and made me come with you leaving the man alone in the night,’ her
                husband wailed. But Kavery was smiling! Then she broke into peals of laughter
                and said, ‘Don’t worry. I had planned this all along. You see, I saved money
                from our last crop to rebuild the house. I needed to call in some labourers to help
                tear it down, but our guest has done it for us! Now we can make a larger house
                for ourselves, just the way we always wanted.’
                The whole village heard the story and started marvelling at her intelligence.
                Many months flew by. The thief was burning to take revenge. How dare that
                village woman trick him, that too not once but twice! He realized that she was
                very clever.
                One day, he dressed up as a bangle seller and started wandering in the village.
                Kavery spotted him and knew who he was at once. She said to her friends who
                were crowding around the bangle seller, ‘Oh dear, I would have loved to get
                some for myself. But ever since that good-for-nothing thief tried to steal all our
                money by tearing down our house, I have hidden everything in a little hole in a
                tree in the woods.’
                ‘Which tree?’ her friends asked.
                ‘Oh no, I am not saying which tree, but it is at last safe and sound out in the
                forest.’
                The thief looked at her. Yes Kavery was wearing an ordinary sari with no
                ornaments at all.
                Her friends turned around in astonishment at the crash with which the bangle
                seller flung down his collection of bangles and made off for the forest. Only
                Kavery watched with a grin on her face.
                Out in the forest, the thief searched high and low for the jewels. He climbed
                trees, poked around in bushes, got bitten, scratched and growled at, but he would
                not give up. The jewels were there somewhere and he had to find them.
                So that is where we will leave him, prowling around in the forest, looking for
                money and gold that don’t belong to him. Everyone praised Kavery for her quick
                wit in ridding the village of the thief. She continued to work hard and made more
                money from her farming and became a rich old lady. Even her husband was
                shamed into giving up his lazy ways and helping her. As for the thief, who
                knows, perhaps he is still in that forest, looking for what was never his. Now if
                only he had learnt to work hard like Kavery—he would have been as rich!
                The children laughed and laughed when the story was over. ‘The poor thief!’
                Meenu and Krishna giggled. ‘Maybe he got eaten by a tiger!’
                Ajji grinned. ‘See,’she told Anand, ‘sometimes with a bit of luck and lots of
                pluck, people can change any situation in which they find themselves!’

            <h5 class="card-title">Who Was the Happiest of Them All?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Meenu was upset. She pouted and sulked and would not talk to Ajji. But how
                can any child be angry with Ajji for very long? Their grandmother was just too
                loving and affectionate for anyone to not tell her what was wrong.
                ‘Ajji, it’s been three days, and you have not told a story about a king yet!’
                Meenu grumbled.
                Ajji nodded. ‘It’s true, Meenu. That was my fault; I should have told you a
                story about a king right away!’
                ‘And I want a good, nice king, who does good, nice things for his people—not
                horrible things like punishing them and jailing them,’ Meenu sat straight and
                demanded.
                ‘All right, dear. Here’s a king, just as you wanted . . .’
                And Ajji began her story.
                King Amrit loved his people and looked after the affairs of his kingdom well.
                His minister, Chandan, was a wise man who helped the king in his work
                tirelessly.
                One day, King Amrit and Chandan were taking a walk on the terrace of the
                palace. The terrace offered beautiful views of the surroundings, and they could
                see far into the distance. They spotted the weekly market from up there, with
                people in colourful clothes buying and selling all kinds of things. There was
                plenty to buy and people had money to buy, too. There were no poor people to
                be seen anywhere. The king watched with a smile on his face. He was delighted
                to see the prosperity of his kingdom. Like any good ruler he was happy when his
                people were happy.
                He turned to Chandan and said, ‘See how contented my people are. But I want
                to check this first-hand by talking to them. Tomorrow, summon people from all
                walks of life to the court, and I will ask them myself how they are doing.’
                Chandan was used to the king’s strange requests, so he nodded and went off to
                carry out this order.
                The next day, the king arrived in court humming a happy tune to himself.
                Seeing all the people gathered there waiting for him, he was even more pleased.
                He cleared his throat and said in a loud voice, ‘I have called you here to ask you
                a very important question. As your king, I need to know if all of you are
                contented. Do you have enough for your needs? Do you know anyone who is not
                happy about anything?’
                The citizens looked at each other, thought for a while and slowly one by one
                they came forward to answer. One after the other they all said how happy they
                were—their kitchens had enough food, their trades and businesses were doing
                well, the king had made them feel safe. The farmers had grown good crops and
                the rivers and ponds were full of fish. What more could they ask for?
                The king became more and more pleased as he heard this. Only Chandan, his
                minister, watched and heard everything with a frown on his face. Why? What
                was wrong? Soon he walked up to the king and whispered something in his ear.
                King Amrit’s eyebrows rose up in astonishment. Surely, Chandan could not be
                serious! But he looked at the minister’s face and found no trace of this being a
                joke.
                He turned back to the court and made a most unusual announcement. ‘I am
                delighted that all of you have said you are happy. But I want to test this.
                Tomorrow, I want all the happy people of this kingdom to come and meet me in
                the royal gardens. But I have a condition. All of you will have to enter the
                garden from the main gate, walk across and meet me by the gate at the rear of
                the garden. I will wait for you there. When you enter the garden you will be
                given a sack each and you can pick whatever fruits or flowers your heart
                desires.’
                An excited buzz broke out among the crowd. It sounded like a lot of fun. No
                one was usually allowed to enter the king’s special garden. He had planted trees
                from all over the world in that garden and it was said to be filled with all kinds
                of beautiful and strange plants.
                Right on time the next day, everyone gathered at the gate of the garden. At the
                time the king had told them, the guards opened the gates and handed out the
                sacks. Men, women and children started roaming around the beautiful garden.
                They spotted juicy apples and plump mangoes hanging from trees. They picked
                these till they saw ripe pomegranates bursting with juice, grapes and colourful
                flowers no one had seen before. People went about picking whatever they
                wished for and filling their sacks with them.
                But as they walked further into the garden it became wilder, more like a forest,
                and there they saw trees laden with apples of gold, mangoes of silver and
                flowers studded with gems and jewels!
                Everyone emptied their sacks of the fruits they had collected earlier and
                started madly filling them up with these precious fruits and flowers. They all
                forgot that they had said they had more than enough for their needs at home.
                Greed took over, their minds and all they could think about was adding more and
                more valuables to their sacks. The fruits which they had picked earlier, and had
                tasted to be as sweet as nectar, now lay in heaps around the garden—forgotten
                and left to rot.
                Then with their sacks filled right to the top, the citizens made their way to the
                rear gate of the garden where the king was waiting. But what was this? To their
                astonishment they found a raging stream stopping their way. Water gushed down
                from behind some rocks and rushed over pebbles and big boulders through the
                garden. The stream was narrow, but the current was strong. There were no boats
                to take the people across. Clearly, the only way was to swim. But how could they
                swim with such heavy sacks filled with gold and silver fruits?

                The people stood by the stream for a long time scratching their heads. Then
                one young man did what they all knew needed to be done. He simply abandoned
                his sack by the stream, waded into the water, then swam across to the other side.
                Slowly the others, too, followed suit. Sadly, some wailing in distress, they left
                their sacks filled with what they had thought was the riches of a lifetime, and
                dived into the stream. Then they walked up to their king—wet, unhappy and
                angry.
                King Amrit and Chandan watched them trudge up in their soaking clothes.
                Chandan had a small smile on his lips, while the king looked sad. When they had
                assembled in front of him, he said, ‘When I asked you yesterday if you were
                happy with your lives, all of you said you were contented and did not need
                anything more. Yet, today I can see the sadness in your faces when you had to
                leave behind the riches you had gathered in my garden. If you were really happy
                with your lives, why did you gather the jewel fruits, and why are you so sad
                now?’
                Everyone looked down, ashamed at their behaviour. Only the young man who
                was the first to cross the stream after leaving his sack behind seemed to be
                unconcerned. Chandan spotted his cheerful face in the crowd and beckoned him
                forward. Then he asked, ‘Tell me, are you not sad you had to leave behind so
                much of wealth that suddenly came your way?’
                The man said, ‘I didn’t pick the jewelled fruits and flowers. I had picked some
                of the lovely, tasty fruits and had eaten my fill of them. In my sack I had kept
                some others for my little daughter who is at home. I had thought she would
                enjoy these tasty apples and mangoes. But when I saw there was no other way to
                go across the stream, I did not think twice about leaving my sack by the river.
                My little girl can get tasty fruits from some other garden, too! But I am so happy
                the king let us all wander around his garden, looking at the trees and plants and
                animals. He is a great king for having created this place of beauty, and it was a
                pleasure walking around there.’
                Finally a smile appeared on King Amrit’s face. Chandan turned to him and
                said, ‘Your Majesty, I hope you now realize that people’s contentment does not
                end with having enough food or money. They also need to be truly happy inside.
                Only then will they not be swayed when they gain or lose wealth. That is a
                lesson that everyone—whether a king or a commoner—needs to remember.’
                The king nodded, as did his subjects. This was a lesson they would not forget
                in a hurry!
                ‘Did you like the story, Meenu?’ Raghu asked.
                ‘Oh yes,’ Meenu nodded. ‘But I liked the minister more than the king!’
                ‘That’s true, Meenu,’ Ajji agreed. ‘Kings did need intelligent ministers to
                show them the right path sometimes. Remember Akbar had Birbal, and
                Krishnadevaraya had Tenali Rama? Why just kings, we all need someone to tell
                us if what we are doing is wrong. It could be our parents, grandparents, teachers
                or even our best friend. The important thing is to listen to them and change our
                ways when needed.’
